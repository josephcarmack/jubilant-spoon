# jubilant-spoon
the birth of $$$

## Description:

jubilant-spoon is a sandbox game designed to approx. real world physics in a way that enables players to lear STEM while they play. It uses cutting edge numerical techniques, real world data, and realistic models to simulate game events in such a way that events mimick real-life.

## expectations:

Physics engine
  -start with basic kinematics, and make extensible
  -voxel based with much finer voxels than minecraft
  -effects to eventually include: Thermo Dyn,Dyn material properties, kinematics (rigid and deformable), collision detection,
    mechanical failure (from impact, wear, environmental degredation etc), areodynamics, nuclear physics, chemistry, computers,
    radio,
  -make building machines like minigames,
  
Graphics engine:
  -???
